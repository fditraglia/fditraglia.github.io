I am an Applied Econometrician, an Associate Professor of Economics at the [University of Oxford](http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk), a Tutor and Fellow in Economics at [Lady Margaret Hall](http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk), and a visiting researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. 
<!-- I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://economics.sas.upenn.edu), a member of the [Warren Center for Network and Data Sciences](http://warrencenter.upenn.edu), and a visiting researcher at the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank. -->
<!-- I came to Penn in 2012 after completing my PhD studies with [Richard Smith](http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/people/crsid.html?crsid=rjs27&group=faculty) at [Cambridge University](http://www.cam.ac.uk).
Before Cambridge, I earned an MA in economics at [UC San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu), an MSc in statistics at the University of [St Andrews](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk) and a BA in economics and mathematics at the [College of William and Mary](http://www.wm.edu). -->
My research uses data to answer economic and public policy questions and develops statistical methods for untangling cause-and-effect.
On the methodological side, my interests include causal inference, instrumental variables, measurement error, spillovers, and Bayesian inference. 
On the applied side, my recent and ongoing work spans a range of topics from childhood lead exposure, to pawn lending, to baseball. 
<!--including childhood lead exposure, includes a project using machine learning to predict the prevalence of lead poisoning in young children, an experimental study of pawnbroking in Mexico City, and a study that uses economic modeling to explain patterns of paramilitary violence in Colombia in during the 1990s and early 2000s.-->
<!-- My research interests include theoretical and applied econometrics, empirical microeconomics, and experimental economics.
The main topics of my current and ongoing research are model selection and averaging, measurement error, and models with social interactions.-->
I am co-founder of [SQARE.org](https://sqare.org) and I blog about econometrics, statistics, and R programming at [econometrics.blog](https://www.econometrics.blog/).
